# Use Case: Find Owners by Last Name

## Overview

**JIRA Ticket ID:** UC-004
**Use Case ID:** find-owners-by-last-name   
**Use Case Name:** Find Owners by Last Name   
**Primary Actor:** Clinic User   
**Goal:** Locate one or more owners by their last name so their details can be reviewed or edited.   
**Status:** Approved

## Preconditions

## Main Success Scenario

1. Clinic User clicks "Find Owners" in the navigation bar.
2. System displays the Find Owners form with a single "Last name" input field.
3. Clinic User enters all or the beginning of an owner's last name and submits the form.
4. System queries the owner repository using a "starts with" match on last name.
5. System finds more than one matching owner and renders the Owners List with infinite scrolling, showing, for each
   owner, their name, address, city, telephone, and pets.
6. Clinic User selects an owner from the list to navigate to the Owner Details view (UC-005).

## Alternative Flows

### A1: Empty Last-Name Search

**Trigger:** Clinic User submits the form with an empty last-name field in step 3.
**Flow:**

1. System treats the empty string as a broadest-possible search and returns all owners, lazily loaded as the user
   scrolls.
2. Use case continues at step 5.

### A2: Exactly One Match

**Trigger:** The "starts with" query returns exactly one owner in step 4.
**Flow:**

1. System navigates directly to the Owner Details view for that owner (UC-005).
2. Use case ends.

### A3: No Match

**Trigger:** The query returns no owners in step 4.
**Flow:**

1. System re-renders the Find Owners form.
2. System attaches the error "not found" to the last-name field.
3. Clinic User adjusts the search term.
4. Use case continues at step 3.

### A4: Scroll Through Results

**Trigger:** The result set is larger than what fits on screen (step 5).
**Flow:**

1. Clinic User scrolls toward the bottom of the Owners List.
2. System fetches the next chunk of owners from the repository and appends them to the list.
3. Use case continues at step 5 or 6.

## Postconditions

### Success Postconditions

- The matching owners are displayed, or the user is redirected to a single owner's details page.
- No data is modified.

### Failure Postconditions

- The Find Owners form is redisplayed with a "not found" message.

## Business Rules

### BR-001: Prefix Match

Searches use a case-sensitive "starts with" match on last name; full-string matches are not required.

### BR-002: Lazy Loading

The Owners List is rendered with infinite scrolling: rows are fetched lazily from the backend as the user scrolls. There
are no user-visible page controls and no fixed page size.

### BR-003: Empty Search Returns All

An empty last-name field returns every owner rather than raising a validation error.
